## Introduction

This repository contains a Python notebook that provides a comprehensive tutorial on Time Series Analysis. The notebook was created as part of a Kaggle course and is designed to help beginners understand the basics of Time Series Analysis and how to implement it in Python.

## Notebook Contents

The notebook covers the following topics:

1. **Linear Regression With Time Series**: Use two features unique to time series: lags and time steps.

2. **Trend**: Model long-term changes with moving averages and the time dummy.

3. **Seasonality**: Create indicators and Fourier features to capture periodic change.

4. **Time Series as Features**: Predict the future from the past with a lag embedding.

5. **Hybrid Models**: Combine the strengths of two forecasters with this powerful technique.

6. **Forecasting With Machine Learning**: Apply ML to any forecasting task with these four strategies.
